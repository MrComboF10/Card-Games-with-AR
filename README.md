# User Manual

To run the application, the user needs to have a phone with a camera
and internet connection with the IP Webcam application downloaded.
Within the application, the user will have to hit the Start server button
and copy the IP address displayed to the url variable in the app file. After
that the user only needs to run the app file. It is highly recommended to
use the same cards as the ones in our dataset in the resized folder.
To check the marker tracking feature use an \textbf{ArUco} marker with the properties defined in section \ref{marker}.
